## Text formatting

* To make the text Italic it should be taken into * symbols or _ symbols. Example *Itaic* or _Italic_

* To make the half bold it should be taken into double "**" symbols or double "__ " symbols. Example **Bold** or __Bold__

Alternative means of text formatting in Italic and bold are for using both formats for the same text. Example. _The text is in Italis while a word is in **bold** and Italic_.

## Lists

To add bullet listing we need to put "*" symbol and a space before the text. Example
* one
* two

To add numerical list we need to put "number and a dot" before the text. Example

1. one
2. two

## Images

To insert an image we need to add ![] () marks and inside the square brackets we should write the discription of the image that will appear if the image does not download and in parenthesis we should right the name of the file mentioning the types of file as well that we have in our folder.
